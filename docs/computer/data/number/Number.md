# Number

A **number** is a mathematical concept used to **count, measure, and label** quantities. It represents an **amount, position, or value** and can be classified into different types based on their properties.  

## Types of Numbers  

### 1. Natural Numbers (ℕ) – Counting Numbers  
- **Definition**: The set of positive whole numbers used for counting.  
- **Notation**: ℕ = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}  
- **Example**: 1, 2, 3, 10, 100  

### 2. Whole Numbers  
- **Definition**: Natural numbers including **zero**.  
- **Notation**: W = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}  
- **Example**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 100  

### 3. Integers (ℤ) – Whole Numbers and Their Negatives  
- **Definition**: All positive and negative whole numbers, including zero.  
- **Notation**: ℤ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}  
- **Example**: -5, -2, 0, 4, 100  

### 4. Rational Numbers (ℚ) – Fractions and Repeating Decimals  
- **Definition**: Any number that can be written as a fraction **a/b**, where **a and b are integers and b ≠ 0**.  
- **Notation**: ℚ = { a/b | a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0 }  
- **Examples**:  
  - 1/2, -3/4, 5 (which is **5/1**)  
  - **Repeating decimals**: 0.333... (**1/3**), 0.666... (**2/3**)  

### 5. Irrational Numbers (ℝ \ ℚ) – Non-Repeating, Non-Terminating Decimals  
- **Definition**: Numbers that **cannot** be expressed as fractions. Their decimal expansion goes on forever without repeating.  
- **Notation**: ℝ \ ℚ  
- **Examples**:  
  - **π (Pi) ≈ 3.141592653...**  
  - **e (Euler’s Number) ≈ 2.718281828...**  
  - **√2 ≈ 1.41421356...**  

### 6. Real Numbers (ℝ) – All Rational and Irrational Numbers  
- **Definition**: The set of all numbers that can be represented on the number line.  
- **Notation**: ℝ  
- **Examples**: -5, 0, 1.5, π, √2  

### 7. Complex Numbers (ℂ) – Numbers with Imaginary Parts  
- **Definition**: Numbers that include a **real part** and an **imaginary part**.  
- **Notation**: ℂ = a + bi, where **a, b ∈ ℝ** and **i = √-1**.  
- **Examples**:  
  - 3 + 4i  
  - -2i (purely imaginary)  

> Complex numbers extend real numbers to solve equations like **x² + 1 = 0**.

## How to Represent Numbers in Binary

- [**Integers**] are represented in binary using **positional notation**.
  
- **Real numbers** are represented approximately in binary using the [**floating-point**] standard (e.g., IEEE 754).

- **Complex numbers** (e.g., numbers involving imaginary components like `i`) are represented by two [floating-point] numbers: one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. `z = a + bi` is stored with `a` and `b` are [floating-point] numbers

# History of Numbers

The concept of **numbers** evolved over time as humans developed methods to **count, measure, and represent quantities**.

## 1. Early Counting Systems  
- **Prehistoric Tallying**: Early humans used notches on bones and objects for counting (e.g., the **Ishango Bone**).  
- **Fingers**: The decimal system likely came from counting on fingers.

## 2. Written Numbers  
- **Sumerians** (3000 BCE): Developed the first written numbers using cuneiform, employing a **base-60** system.  
- **Egyptians**: Used a **base-10 (decimal)** system and fractions.

## 3. The Concept of Zero  
- **Babylonians** (300 BCE): Introduced zero as a placeholder.  
- **Indians** (5th century CE): Developed zero as a number in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

## 4. Rational Numbers (ℚ)  
- **Rational numbers** (fractions like `a/b` were first formalized by the **Greeks**, and used by the **Egyptians**.

## 5. Irrational Numbers  
- **Greeks** discovered irrational numbers like **squrt** and **π**, challenging the concept of whole number ratios.

## 6. Real Numbers (ℝ)  
- **Real numbers** (rational + irrational) were formalized as a continuous number line, building on Greek and later work by **Descartes** and **Newton**.

## 7. Complex Numbers (ℂ)  
- **Imaginary numbers** were introduced in the 16th century by mathematicians like **Bombelli** to solve equations without real solutions (x^2 + 1 = 0).
