# Number

A **number** is a mathematical concept used to **count, measure, and label** quantities. It represents an **amount, position, or value** and can be classified into different types based on their properties.  

## Types of Numbers  

| **Type**            | **Definition**                                                                 | **Notation**              | **Examples**                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Natural Numbers** | Positive whole numbers used for counting.                                   | ℕ = {1, 2, 3, ...}       | 1, 2, 3, 10, 100             |
| **Whole Numbers**   | Natural numbers including **zero**.                                        | W = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}    | 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 100         |
| **Integers**        | All positive and negative whole numbers, including zero.                   | ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, ...} | -5, -2, 0, 4, 100          |
| **Rational Numbers**| Numbers that can be written as a fraction **a/b**, where **b ≠ 0**.        | ℚ = { a/b | a, b ∈ ℤ, b ≠ 0 } | 1/2, -3/4, 5, 0.333... (1/3) |
| **Irrational Numbers** | Non-repeating, non-terminating decimals that cannot be written as fractions. | ℝ \ ℚ | π ≈ 3.14159, e ≈ 2.71828, √2 ≈ 1.414 |
| **Real Numbers**    | All rational and irrational numbers.                                        | ℝ                          | -5, 0, 1.5, π, √2           |
| **Complex Numbers** | Numbers with a real and an imaginary part.                                 | ℂ = a + bi, where **i = √-1** | 3 + 4i, -2i (purely imaginary) |

Relationship Between Number Sets: `ℕ ⊂ W ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ`

## How to Represent Numbers in Binary

- [**Integers**] are represented in binary using **positional notation**.
  
- **Real numbers** are represented approximately in binary using the **[floating-point]** standard (e.g., IEEE 754).

- **Complex numbers** (e.g., numbers involving imaginary components like `i`) are represented by two **[floating-point]** numbers: one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. `z = a + bi` is stored with `a` and `b` are **[floating-point]** numbers

# History of Numbers

The concept of **numbers** evolved over time as humans developed methods to **count, measure, and represent quantities**.

## Early Counting Systems  
- **Prehistoric Tallying**: Early humans used notches on bones and objects for counting (e.g., the Ishango Bone).  
- **Fingers**: The decimal system likely came from counting on fingers.

## Written Numbers  
- **Sumerians** (3000 BCE): Developed the first written numbers using cuneiform, employing a*base-60 system.  
- **Egyptians**: Used a base-10 (decimal) system and fractions.

## The Concept of Zero  
- **Babylonians** (300 BCE): Introduced zero as a placeholder.  
- **Indians** (5th century CE): Developed zero as a number in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

## Rational Numbers (ℚ)  
- **Rational numbers** (fractions like `a/b` were first formalized by the Greeks, and used by the Egyptians.

## Irrational Numbers  
- **Greeks** discovered irrational numbers like `squrt(2)` and `π`, challenging the concept of whole number ratios.

## Real Numbers (ℝ)  
- **Real numbers** (rational + irrational) were formalized as a continuous number line, building on Greek and later work by **Descartes** and **Newton**.

## Complex Numbers (ℂ)
- **Imaginary numbers** were introduced in the 16th century by mathematicians like **Bombelli** to solve equations without real solutions (x^2 + 1 = 0).
