# Text

## What is Text

**Text** is a sequence of characters, symbols, or words used to convey information, thoughts, or meaning. It is a fundamental part of communication.

Example: This document is written using sequence of symbols to convey an information about text itself.

## How to Represent Text in Binary

**Text** is represented as sequence of **[integers]**, each character is assigned a unique code follow an encoding scheme.

Common encoding schemes include:
- ASCII (7-bit, 128 characters)
- Extended ASCII (8-bit, 256 characters)
- UTF-8 (1–4 bytes per character) - General Use
- UTF-16 (2 or 4 bytes per character) - 
- UTF-32 (4 bytes per character)

### Example: Convert "Hi" to binary using ASCII encoding

We have:

- `H` → `072` → `01001000`
- `i` → `105` → `01101001`

Then "Hi" will be `01001000 01101001`

## History of Text

- Ancient Writing (c. 3200 BCE) – Early civilizations (Sumerians, Egyptians) developed cuneiform and hieroglyphs for record-keeping.
- Alphabets (c. 1000 BCE) – The Phoenicians created one of the first alphabets, later refined by Greeks and Romans.
- Manuscripts & Books (Middle Ages) – Scribes copied texts by hand; printing was rare.
- Printing Press (1440 CE) – Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type press, revolutionizing mass text production.
- Typewriters & Mechanical Writing (1800s–1900s) – Allowed efficient text creation and documentation.
- Digital Text (1950s–Present) – Computers began storing text using ASCII, Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.), enabling global digital communication.
- AI & Text Processing (21st Century) – Natural language processing (NLP) enables text analysis, translation, and AI-generated writing.
