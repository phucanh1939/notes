# **Logic Gate**

## **What is a Logic Gate?**

A logic gate is the physical representation of a logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), takes binary input and generate output

Logic gates can be used to forms complex circuits for a computer: ALU, register, RAM, Flip-Flop, Multiplexer, Decoder, etc.

## **How a Logic Gate Works**

Electrical current flows through the input terminals of the gate, passing through internally connected transistors. These transistors manipulate the signals producing the corresponding output.

Example:
- **AND Gate**: Uses two transistors in series—both must be ON for output to be HIGH (1).
- **OR Gate**: Uses two transistors in parallel—either one can be ON for output to be HIGH (1).
- **NOT Gate (Inverter)**: Uses a single transistor to invert the input (0 → 1, 1 → 0).

## **How to Create a Logic Gate (from Transistors)**

In actual hardware (CPUs, RAM, etc.), circuits mostly use **universal gates**: **NAND** or **NOR**

**Universal Gates** are gates that can create any logic function.

**Universal Gates** are built directly using transistors (wire thems together).

Other gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) are built using **universal gates**

```
// Using NAND
NOT A = A NAND A
A AND B = (A NAND B) NAND (A NAND B)
A OR B = (A' NAND B')' = (A NAND A) NAND (B NAND B)

// Using NOR
NOT A = A NOR A
A OR B = (A NOR B) NOR (A NOR B)
A AND B = (A' NOR B')' = (A NOR A) NOR (B NOR B)
```
