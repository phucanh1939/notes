# Computer Architecture

**Computer Architecture** is the study of how computer systems are designed and organized. 
It focuses on the structure and behavior of a computer system especially Processor (CPU) and Memory - main components for computer to do its job - processing data

### 1. Instruction & Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- The interface between hardware and software.
- Defines available instructions, registers, and memory addressing modes.

### 2. Microarchitecture
- Internal design of a CPU.
- Includes pipelines, caches, and execution units.

### 3. Memory Hierarchy
- Organization of RAM, cache, and storage.
- Optimization for performance and efficiency.

### 4. Input/Output (I/O) Systems
- How the CPU communicates with peripherals.
- Includes devices like keyboards, GPUs, and storage.

### 5. Parallelism & Performance
- Techniques like pipelining and multi-core processors.
- Optimizing for speed and efficiency.
