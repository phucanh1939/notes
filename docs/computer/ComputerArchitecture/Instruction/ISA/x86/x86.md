# x86

**x86** is a **Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC)** architecture developed by Intel. It has powered personal computers since the late 1970s and remains dominant in desktop, laptop, and server markets.

## Key Features

- CISC design: complex, variable-length instructions
- Rich instruction set with many addressing modes
- Backward compatibility: runs software from older generations
- Supports multiple data sizes: 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit
- Modern x86-64 (aka AMD64): 64-bit extension of x86
- Includes SIMD extensions (MMX, SSE, AVX)

## Why x86 is Popular

- Long-standing industry standard
- Broad support from OSes, compilers, and tools
- High performance in general-purpose computing
- Used in most PCs, laptops, and many servers
