# Compiler

A compiler is a program that translates high-level programming code into machine code or bytecode (machine independent instruction).

Types of compilers:
- Native compiler: compiles code directly into machine code.
- Bytecode compiler: compiles code to bytecode (machine independent instruction)

## How does a Compiler compile code to machine code

### Native Compiler

Compiler that compiles code directly into machine code.

#### Front end

The front end is responsible for analyzing the source code and converting it into an intermediate representation (IR).

Front end is lanaguage dependent

Main task:
- Lexical Analysis: Breaking the source code into tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers, etc.).
- Syntax & Semantic Analysis (Parsing): Analyzes the sequence of tokens to build an abstract syntax tree (AST), which represents the grammatical structure of the code. Check for syntax & semantic errors.
- Code Generation: Generate Intermediate Representation (IR) from the AST. IR is 

#### Middle End

The middle end focuses on optimizing IR without changing program logic. This could include optimizations like loop unrolling, inlining, constant folding, and dead code elimination.

#### Back End

The back end is responsible for translating the IR into machine code, generate object file for each source file

### Bytecode Compiler

Source files are compiled into bytecode files

Bytecode files, metadata and resources then packed into an application package
