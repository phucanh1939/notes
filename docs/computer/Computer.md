# Computer

## What is a Computer?
A computer is a programmable electronic device designed to process **[data]** and perform tasks by executing **[programs][program]**.
It can handle a wide range of operations, from simple calculations to complex **[data]** analysis, based on the instructions provided.

**Types of Computers**:
- Personal Computers (PCs)
- Servers
- Supercomputers
- Embedded Computers
- Personal mobile devices (PMDs)
- Cloud

## How a Computer Processes Data
For a computer to process **[data]**, the following steps are involved:
1. **Define the Data to Process**: Represent the **[data]** in a binary format that the computer can understand.
2. **Create a [Program][program]**: Write a set of **[instructions][instruction]** (a **[program]**) that describes how the **[data]** should be processed.

### Data Processing Workflow:
1. **Input Data**: **[Data]** is loaded into **[memory]** from an **[input device][indevice]** (e.g., keyboard, mouse) or a **[file]** in **[storage]**.
2. **Program Loading**: The program is also loaded into **[memory]**.
3. **Execution**: The **[processor]** fetches **[data]** and **[instructions][instruction]** from **[memory]** and executes them.
4. **Output Data**: The processed data is written back into **[memory]**.
5. **Output Presentation**: The output data can be written into **[storage]** (as **[files]**) or read by an **[output device][outdevice]** (e.g., monitor, printer) to present it to the user.

### Basic Components of a Computer
- **[Input Device][indevice]**: Used to provide input data to the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, microphone).
- **[Storage]**: Stores data and programs permanently (e.g., HDD, SSD).
- **[Memory]**: Temporarily stores data and programs that are currently being used for processing.
- **[Processor]**: Executes instructions to process the data.
- **[Output Device][outdevice]**: Reads data from memory and presents it to the user (e.g., monitor, speaker, printer).

### Other Important Components
- **[Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)][gpu]**: Handles graphics rendering and parallel processing tasks.
- **[Power Supply Unit (PSU)][psu]**: Provides power to the computer system.
- **[Cooling System][cooling-system]**: Prevents overheating by dissipating heat (e.g., fans, heat sinks).
- **[Network Interface Card (NIC)][nic]**: Enables network connectivity.

### Example: Extracting Sentences with a Keyword
A computer [program] to extract all sentences in a text document that contain a keyword:
1. **Data to Process**: A text document and a keyword, represented in binary as **[string]**.
2. **Program**: Instructions to find all sentences containing the keyword.
3. **Execution**:
   - The [program] is loaded into [memory].
   - The input text document is loaded into [memory] from an input device or [storage].
   - The processor executes the [program], identifying sentences with the keyword.
   - The output is displayed on a screen or saved to [storage].

## How is a Computer Made?
1. **Silicon**: Used to make **[transistors][transistor]**, which act as tiny electronic switches.
2. **[Transistors][transistor]**: Combined to form **[logic gates][logic-gate]** (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).
3. **[Logic Gates][logic-gate]**: Used to build **[circuit blocks][circuit-block]** like **[decoder], [multiplexer], [ALU], and [register]**.
4. **[Circuit Blocks][circuit-block]**: Form **core components** such as **[CPU][processor], [RAM][ram], [GPU], and [controllers]**.
5. **[Integrated Circuits (ICs)][IC]**: Core components are fabricated into microchips.
6. **[Motherboard]**: [ICs][IC], [storage], [cooling systems][cooling-system], and I/O ports are assembled onto a **motherboard**.

### Performance of a Computer

Performance is how efficiently it can execute tasks, often measured by how quickly it can complete a given workload.
The most important metric is **CPU execution time**.

**CPU execution time** is the time the [CPU] spends computing for a specific task

```c
// CPU_EXECUTION_TIME: CPU execution time for a program
// NUMBER_OF_CLOCK_CYCLE: total number of clock cycles of this program
// CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME: Time of a clock cycle of the CPU
CPU_EXECUTION_TIME = NUMBER_OF_CLOCK_CYCLES * CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME;

// NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTION: total number of instructions of this program
// CPI: Average number of clock cycles per instruction (each type of instruction has different clock cycles needed to execute)
NUMBER_OF_CLOCK_CYCLES = NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTION * CPI;
```

`NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTION` is affected by the code, [ISA] and [compiler]
`CPI` and `CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME` is affected by the implementation of the hardware (processor)

### Subjects about Computer

- **[Computer Architecture]**: Studies how computer components are structured and work together to process data.
- **[Operating System]**:  Studies how software manages hardware resources and provides system
- **[Computer Network]**: Studies how computers communicate and share data over networks.
- **[Computer Graphics]**: Studies how images, animations, and visual content are generated and displayed on screens.

As processors become faster and more powerful, they consume significantly more energy.
Traditionally, higher clock speeds (smaller time to execute task) and smaller [transistors][transistor] (more transistors = more computational units) helped improve performance, but they also led to increased power usage and heat dissipation issues.

=> The shift to [multi-core processor][core] has become more prevalent.

[Multi-core processors][core] enhance performance while maintaining energy efficiency. To fully utilize multiple processors, programs must be designed for parallel execution. However, this introduces challenges such as synchronization, data sharing, and workload distribution.
