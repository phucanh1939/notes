## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

**Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** refers to the set of instructions that a processor can understand and execute. It defines the interface between software and hardware, dictating how a CPU communicates with memory and performs tasks.

### Popular ISAs:

1. **x86** **x86-64**
   - **Developer**: Intel, ADM (64 bit version)
   - **Use**: Commonly used in **PCs** and **servers**.
   - **Chips**: Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, etc.
   - **Description**: A **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)** ISA, supporting a wide range of complex instructions for enhanced functionality.

2. **ARM (ARMv7, ARMv8, ARMv9)**
   - **Developer**: Arm Holdings (ARM designs the ISA, but other companies create chips based on it).
   - **Use**: **Mobile devices**, **embedded systems**, and **low-power devices**.
   - **Chips**: Apple M1, Apple M2, Qualcomm Snapdragon, etc.
   - **Description**: A **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)** ISA known for its simplicity, efficiency, and power-saving benefits. ARM processors are highly customizable, making them popular in mobile and embedded markets.

3. **MIPS**
   - **Developer**: MIPS Computer Systems (now not actively developed anymore).
   - **Use**: Primarily used in **education** and some **embedded systems**.
   - **Chips**: MIPS R4000, used in network devices, early gaming consoles.
   - **Description**: A **RISC** architecture, known for its simplicity, where each instruction typically performs a single operation. Itâ€™s often used in educational settings to teach computer architecture concepts.
