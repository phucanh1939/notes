# Core Mechanics for Hypercasual Game

## Movement & Avoidance

### Zig-Zag  
The player controls a character moving forward automatically, and taps to switch direction (left/right). Obstacles appear in the path, requiring precise timing and reflexes.  
**Variations:** Different speeds, varying obstacle patterns, power-ups.

### Spiral  
The player controls a character spiraling inwards or outwards. Obstacles are arranged in circular patterns, demanding quick adjustments.  
**Variations:** Changing spiral direction, gaps in the circles, moving obstacles.

### Rise & Fall  
The player controls the vertical movement of a character (e.g., a bird). Tapping makes it rise, releasing makes it fall. The goal is to navigate through gaps in obstacles.  
**Variations:** Different falling speeds, moving obstacles, wind gusts affecting movement.

### Lane Changing  
The player controls a character moving forward automatically and can swipe to change lanes (typically 3-4 lanes). Obstacles appear in different lanes, requiring quick lane changes.  
**Variations:** Different lane widths, obstacles that span multiple lanes, power-ups that clear lanes.

## Timing & Precision

### Stacking  
Objects fall from above, and the player taps to stack them. The goal is to build the highest possible tower.  
**Variations:** Different object sizes and shapes, moving platforms, wind gusts.

### Jumping/Landing  
The player taps to make a character jump. The goal is to land on increasingly smaller platforms.  
**Variations:** Varying jump heights, moving platforms, platforms that disappear.

### Catching  
Objects fall from above, and the player swipes to move a character/container to catch them.  
**Variations:** Different object speeds and sizes, bonus objects, penalty objects.

### One-Touch Jumper  
The player taps to make a character jump. The height of the jump is determined by how long the player holds the tap. The goal is to jump between platforms of varying heights.  
**Variations:** Moving platforms, platforms that change size, obstacles on platforms.

## Shooting & Targeting

### One-Touch Shooter  
The player taps to shoot. The character/weapon automatically aims at the nearest target.  
**Variations:** Different weapon types, enemy types, power-ups.

### Trajectory Shooter  
The player drags to aim and then releases to shoot. The goal is to hit targets at different distances and positions.  
**Variations:** Different projectile types, moving targets, obstacles.

## Other

### Merging  
The player controls the movement of a small object. Colliding with other objects of the same color merges them into a larger object. The goal is to create the largest possible object or reach a specific size.  
**Variations:** Different object colors, obstacles, time limits.

### Color Matching  
Objects of different colors fall from above. The player controls a character that can change color. The goal is to match the character's color to the falling objects to catch them.  
**Variations:** Faster falling speeds, more colors, power-ups.

### Line Tracing  
The player must trace or follow a path by dragging their finger along a predefined route. Straying from the line results in failure.  
**Variations:** Increasing speed, moving obstacles, disappearing paths.

### Drag & Release  
The player drags an object and releases it at the right moment to hit a target or reach a goal.  
**Variations:** Bouncing mechanics, wind interference, moving targets.

### Stack & Collapse  
The player builds a structure by stacking objects, then interacts to cause a controlled collapse, aiming for a specific outcome.  
**Variations:** Different object shapes, physics-based mechanics, multiple collapse strategies.

## Key Considerations for Hypercasual Mechanics

- **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and pick up in seconds.
- **Intuitive Controls:** One-touch or simple swipe controls are ideal.
- **Addictive Gameplay:** Short, rewarding gameplay loops that encourage replayability.
- **Progression:** Difficulty should ramp up quickly but fairly.
- **Visual Appeal:** Bright, colorful, and eye-catching graphics.
