# ARM

**ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)** is a RISC-based Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed for low power, high efficiency computing. It is widely used in:

- Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets)
- Embedded systems (IoT, microcontrollers)
- Servers and desktops (Apple M1/M2, AWS Graviton)

## Key Features

- RISC design: simple, fixed-size instructions for speed and efficiency
- Load/store architecture: only specific instructions access memory
- Register-based operations: most computations happen in registers
- Conditional execution: many instructions include built-in condition flags
- Multiple execution modes: User, Supervisor, etc.
- Thumb & Thumb-2: compressed 16-bit instruction sets for smaller code
- ARMv8-A: 64-bit architecture used in modern ARM chips

## Why ARM is Popular

- Energy efficient – ideal for battery-powered devices (mobile devices) 
- Scalable – from small microcontrollers to powerful CPUs  
- Widely adopted – used by Apple, Raspberry Pi, Qualcomm, and more  
- Strong ecosystem – good tools, documentation, and community support
