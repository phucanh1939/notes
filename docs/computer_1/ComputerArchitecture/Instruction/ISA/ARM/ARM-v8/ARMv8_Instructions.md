# ARMv8 Instruction Set

The ARMv8-A instruction set is designed for 64-bit processors, supporting both 64-bit and backward-compatible 32-bit applications.

In ARMv8, each instruction is encoded in a 32-bit word (AArch32) or 64-bit word (AArch64) depending on the mode. The instructions are categorized into various types based on their functions, such as data processing, memory access, branching, etc. Each instruction can also have specific conditions for conditional execution based on flags set by previous operations.

## 1. Data Processing Instructions
These instructions perform operations on registers or immediate values.

Arithmetic and logical and instructions have an `s` suffix that makes the instruction update the condition flags in the Program Status Register (CPSR) and (NZCV)

## 7. Conditional Execution
ARMv8 uses a conditional execution model that allows you to execute instructions based on certain flags (like Zero, Negative, Carry, and Overflow flags).

- **Conditional Instructions**:
  - Most ARMv8 instructions can be executed conditionally based on the status of flags. For example:
    - `eq`: Execute if equal.
    - `ne`: Execute if not equal.
    - `lt`: Execute if less than.
    - `gt`: Execute if greater than.
  
  You can suffix instructions with a condition (e.g., `addeq` to add if equal).

## 8. Miscellaneous Instructions
These include special instructions for specific needs.

- **NOP**: No operation (used for timing or debugging).
- **CLZ**: Count leading zeros (counts how many leading zeros in a register's value).
- **REV**: Reverse the byte order in a register.
- **SEL**: Conditional select between two registers.
