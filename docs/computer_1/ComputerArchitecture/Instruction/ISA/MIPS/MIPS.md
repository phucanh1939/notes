# MIPS

**MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages)** is a **RISC-based ISA** developed in the 1980s, known for its simplicity and clean design. It's commonly used in education, embedded systems, and some networking devices.

## Key Features

- RISC design: fixed-size 32-bit instructions
- Load/store architecture: only load/store instructions access memory
- Simple and consistent instruction formats
- 32 general-purpose registers
- Pipeline-friendly design
- Supports multiple modes: User, Kernel

## Why MIPS is Popular

- Easy to learn and implement
- Widely used in academia for teaching ISA and pipelining
- Found in some embedded systems, routers, and SoCs
