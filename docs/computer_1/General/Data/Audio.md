# Audio

## What is Audio?

In the digital world, **audio** is the **electronic representation** of **sound**.

- **Sound** is a **physical wave** created by vibrations (e.g., a drumbeat in the air).  
- **Sound itself carries no inherent information**—it is simply a vibration traveling through a medium (air, water, etc.).  
- Only the properties of sound (like amplitude and frequency) can be recorded as data.  

## **How Sound Properties Are Recorded into Audio**

**We Record Sound Properties, NOT Sound Itself!**  Since **sound is not data**

**Process of Recording Sound properties:**
  - A **microphone** detects air vibrations (sound waves) and convert them into an **analog electrical signal**
  - The analog signal is converted to digital data through sampling and quantization (approximation of continuous data)
   - **Sampling**: The continuous analog signal is measured at **fixed time intervals** (e.g., **44.1kHz** = 44,100 samples per second).  
   - **Quantization**: Each sample’s amplitude is assigned a **numeric value** (determined by **bit depth**).  
     - Example: **16-bit audio** allows **65,536** possible amplitude values.  
  - The result is a **sequence of numbers** representing amplitude over time stored in **audio file** 

### Common Audio Formats

| **Format**  | **Compression** | **Description** | **Best For** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **PCM**     | None (Raw)     | Raw, uncompressed digital audio used in CDs and studio recording. | Professional recording, CD audio. |
| **WAV**     | None (Raw) / Lossless | Uncompressed or lossless audio format developed by Microsoft and IBM. | Professional audio editing, archiving. |
| **AIFF**    | None (Raw) / Lossless | Apple's uncompressed format, similar to WAV. | High-quality audio storage, Apple devices. |
| **BWF**     | None (Raw) / Lossless | Broadcast WAV, used in radio and film industries with metadata support. | Broadcasting, film production. |
| **FLAC**    | Lossless      | Compressed lossless format, reducing file size without quality loss. | High-quality music storage, audiophiles. |
| **ALAC**    | Lossless      | Apple’s lossless compressed format, similar to FLAC. | Apple ecosystem, high-quality audio. |
| **DSD**     | Lossless      | High-resolution format used in SACD (Super Audio CDs). | High-fidelity audio, professional production. |
| **MP3**     | Lossy         | Most popular format with good compression but some quality loss. | Music streaming, general listening. |
| **AAC**     | Lossy         | Improved MP3 alternative with better compression and quality. | Streaming, Apple Music, YouTube. |
| **OGG (Vorbis)** | Lossy  | Open-source alternative to MP3 with better quality at the same bitrate. | Streaming, gaming, open-source applications. |
| **Opus**    | Lossy         | Highly efficient format optimized for streaming and voice. | VoIP, streaming, real-time audio. |
| **WMA**     | Lossy/Lossless | Microsoft's format, used in Windows environments. | Windows-based applications. |

## History of Audio

### Early Mechanical & Analog Audio
- **1857** – *Phonautograph*: First device to record sound (Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville). Couldn’t play it back.
- **1877** – *Phonograph*: Thomas Edison invented the first machine to record and reproduce sound.
- **1887** – *Gramophone*: Emile Berliner introduced flat discs (vinyl records), replacing cylinders.
- **1920s** – Electrical recording replaced purely mechanical methods, improving audio quality.
- **1930s-1950s** – Magnetic tape recording developed, enabling editing and better sound quality.

### Transition to Digital Audio
- **1960s-1970s** – Early experiments with digital audio recording.
- **1982** – *Compact Disc (CD)* released, introducing digital audio to the public.
- **1990s** – MP3 format developed, revolutionizing digital music with compression.
- **2000s** – Streaming services (e.g., iTunes, Spotify) changed how people access music.
- **2010s-Present** – High-resolution audio, lossless formats (FLAC, ALAC), and AI-enhanced audio processing emerge.

### Current Era
- Digital audio is now the dominant format, used in music, movies, games, and communication.
- AI and machine learning enhance audio restoration, speech recognition, and synthesis.
- Lossless and high-resolution audio formats continue to evolve for better sound quality.
