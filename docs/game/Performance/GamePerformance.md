# Game Performance

Game performance is crucial for providing a smooth and enjoyable experience. This document outlines key performance metrics, their measurement, common issues, and possible solutions.

## Metrics for Measuring Game Performance

### Frame Rate (FPS - Frames Per Second)

Frame Rate (FPS) is the number of frames rendered per second. A higher FPS ensures smooth gameplay.

#### How to Measure
- Use in-game FPS counters.  
- Tools like FRAPS, MSI Afterburner, or built-in game engines' profilers (Unity Profiler, Unreal Insights).

#### Common Issues
- High CPU/GPU load.  
- Inefficient rendering pipeline.  
- Overdraw and excessive draw calls.
- Excessive background computations.

#### Solutions
- Optimize game loops and rendering.  
- Reduce unnecessary draw calls.  
- Use occlusion culling and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques.
- Reduce unnecessary physics or AI calculations per frame.

### CPU Utilization
CPU Utilization is the percentage of CPU resources used by the game.

#### How to Measure 
- Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (macOS).  
- Unity Profiler, Unreal Engine Stat Commands.

#### Common Issues
- Expensive computations in the main thread.  
- Poor multithreading.

#### Solutions
- Optimize AI, physics, and logic.  
- Utilize multithreading or job systems.

### GPU Utilization

GPU Utilization is the percentage of GPU resources used by the game.

#### How to Measure 
- GPU-Z, NVIDIA/AMD performance tools.  
- Unity Profiler, Unreal Insights.

#### Common Issues
- High resolution textures consuming VRAM.  
- Excessive shader complexity.

#### Solutions
- Optimize shaders and use texture streaming.  
- Reduce resolution and use LOD models.

### Memory Usage (RAM & VRAM)

The amount of system memory (RAM) and graphics memory (VRAM) used by the game.

#### How to Measure 
- Task Manager, GPU-Z, Unity Profiler, Unreal Engine Stats.

#### Common Issues
- Memory leaks.  
- Unoptimized asset loading.

#### Solutions
- Implement memory pooling.  
- Use efficient asset streaming.

### Draw Calls
The number of individual rendering requests sent to the GPU per frame.

#### How to Measure 
- Unity Profiler, Unreal Engine Stat Commands.

#### Common Issues
- Too many objects rendered separately.  
- No batching or instancing.

#### Solutions
- Use object batching and instancing.  
- Merge static meshes where possible.

### Latency (Input & Network Delay)
Latency is the delay between user input and the on-screen response.  

#### How to Measure 
- For input lag: High-speed cameras, in-game debugging tools.  
- For network latency: Ping test, Wireshark, built-in network profiling.

#### Common Issues
- Unoptimized input handling.  
- Poor netcode causing lag spikes.

#### Solutions
- Optimize input handling and event polling.  
- Implement lag compensation techniques in multiplayer games.

### Load Time
- The time taken to load levels or assets in a game.

#### How to Measure 
- Built-in engine profiling tools.  
- Manual stopwatch testing.

#### Common Issues
- Large uncompressed assets.  
- Blocking operations on the main thread.

#### Solutions
- Use asynchronous asset loading.  
- Compress and optimize assets.

### Physics Performance
The efficiency of in-game physics calculations.

#### How to Measure 
- Physics Profiler in Unity.  
- Unreal Engine Physics Debugging Tools.

#### Common Issues
- Too many rigid bodies.  
- Complex collision detection.

#### Solutions
- Simplify colliders.  
- Reduce physics update frequency if possible.

### AI Performance
The processing efficiency of AI behaviors.

#### How to Measure 
- AI Profiler in Unity.  
- Unreal Engine AI Debugging Tools.

#### Common Issues
- Expensive pathfinding computations.  
- Too many active AI agents.

#### Solutions
- Implement spatial partitioning.  
- Reduce AI update frequency or use LOD for AI processing.

### Build Size
The total file size of the game build, including assets, code, and dependencies.

#### How to Measure
- Check the final packaged game size on disk.  
- Use engine-specific tools (e.g., Unity Build Report, Unreal Engine Size Map).

#### Common Issues
- Uncompressed or unused assets.  
- Large texture, audio, or video files.  
- Including unnecessary dependencies or debug symbols.

#### Solutions
- Compress textures, audio, and video files.
- Remove unused assets and optimize asset bundles.
- Strip debug symbols and unused code from the final build.
