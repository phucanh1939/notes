## Gameplay Overview

### Core Mechanics
- **Auto-Progression**: The game starts at Level 1 automatically. After clearing a level, it progresses to the next without player input. Plant and hero placements persist (no reset).
- **Lane-Based Combat**: 
  - 5 total lanes.
  - Plants attack only in their own lane.
- **Plant Deployment**:
  - Maximum **10 plant slots** (2 per lane) and **5 hero slots**.
  - No plant selection: players merge two same-tier plants to create a higher-tier (+1) plant.
  - New lowest-tier plants can be spawned by:
    - Using coins.
    - Automatically every *X* seconds (if an empty slot is available).
  - Plants can be repositioned freely.
- **Heroes**:
  - Each hero has a unique skill.
  - Occupies separate slots from plants.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - If a level is failed, the game auto-restarts at that level.
- **Idle Progression**:
  - Game continues progressing even when the player is in other menus (shop, home, etc.).
- **Temporary Boosts**:
  - Players can boost plant/hero attack speed temporarily using gems or ads.
