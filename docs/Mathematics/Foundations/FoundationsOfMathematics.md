# Foundations of Mathematics

**Foundations of Mathematics** studies the **basic principles, structures, and logic** underlying all of mathematics — it asks:  
> “What is math built on, and why does it work?”

---

## 1. Logic
- **Studies:** Principles of valid reasoning and arguments.  
- **Key concepts:** Propositions, logical connectives (and, or, not), quantifiers (∀, ∃), truth tables, implication, equivalence.  
- **Purpose:** Provides the **framework for rigorous reasoning**; ensures all mathematical statements and proofs are consistent and valid.

---

## 2. Set Theory
- **Studies:** Collections of objects (“sets”) and their relationships.  
- **Key concepts:** Union, intersection, subsets, power sets, Cartesian products, relations.  
- **Purpose:** Provides the **language and building blocks** for defining numbers, functions, and structures across mathematics.

---

## 3. Number Systems / Arithmetic Foundations
- **Studies:** Natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, and their properties.  
- **Key concepts:** Primes, divisibility, GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic.  
- **Purpose:** Formalizes **numbers and operations** used throughout mathematics.

---

## 4. Proof Theory
- **Studies:** Structure and methods of proofs.  
- **Key concepts:** Direct proof, contradiction, contrapositive, induction.  
- **Purpose:** Develops methods to **justify all mathematical statements rigorously**.

---

## 5. Model Theory
- **Studies:** Mathematical structures that satisfy given axioms.  
- **Key concepts:** Models, interpretations, consistency, completeness.  
- **Purpose:** Shows how **abstract theories can be realized concretely**.

---

## 6. Type Theory
- **Studies:** Objects classified by “types” to avoid paradoxes.  
- **Key concepts:** Types, dependent types, functions between types.  
- **Purpose:** Alternative foundation emphasizing **computation and logical rigor**.

---

## 7. Category Theory
- **Studies:** Relationships (morphisms) between mathematical structures.  
- **Key concepts:** Objects, arrows, functors, commutative diagrams.  
- **Purpose:** Provides a **high-level, unifying view** across mathematics.

### Summary
The foundations of mathematics provide the **rules, structures, and methods** that let us define numbers, sets, proofs, and abstract structures, forming the base for all higher mathematics.
