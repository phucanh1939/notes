# Foundations of Mathematics

**Foundations of Mathematics** is the branch that studies the **basic principles, structures, and logic** underlying all of mathematics — it asks **“what is math built on, and why does it work?”**


## 1. Set Theory
- **Studies:** Collections of objects (“sets”) and their relationships.  
- **Key concepts:** Union, intersection, subsets, power sets, Cartesian products, relations, functions.  
- **Purpose:** Provides the **language and building blocks** for all of mathematics.  

---

## 2. Logic
- **Studies:** Principles of valid reasoning and proofs.  
- **Key concepts:** Propositions, connectives (and, or, not), quantifiers (∀, ∃), truth tables, implication, equivalence.  
- **Purpose:** Ensures that mathematical arguments are **rigorous and consistent**.  

---

## 3. Number Systems / Arithmetic Foundations
- **Studies:** Natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, and their properties.  
- **Key concepts:** Primes, divisibility, GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic.  
- **Purpose:** Gives **formal definitions of numbers** used in all of math.  

---

## 4. Functions and Mappings
- **Studies:** Relationships between elements of sets.  
- **Key concepts:** Domain, codomain, injective/surjective/bijective, composition, inverse.  
- **Purpose:** Formalizes **how one object relates to another**.  

---

## 5. Proof Theory
- **Studies:** Structure and types of proofs.  
- **Key concepts:** Direct proof, contradiction, contrapositive, induction.  
- **Purpose:** Develops methods to **justify all mathematical statements**.  

---

## 6. Model Theory
- **Studies:** Mathematical structures that satisfy given axioms.  
- **Key concepts:** Models, interpretations, consistency, completeness.  
- **Purpose:** Shows **how abstract theories can exist concretely**.  

---

## 7. Type Theory
- **Studies:** Objects classified by “types” to avoid paradoxes.  
- **Key concepts:** Types, dependent types, functions between types.  
- **Purpose:** Alternative foundation emphasizing **computation and rigor**.  

---

## 8. Category Theory
- **Studies:** Relationships (morphisms) between mathematical structures.  
- **Key concepts:** Objects, arrows, functors, commutative diagrams.  
- **Purpose:** Provides a **high-level, unifying view** of mathematics.

### In short
> **Foundations of Mathematics** = “the rules, structures, and methods” that let us define numbers, functions, sets, and proofs, forming the base for all higher mathematics.
