# Logic in Foundations of Mathematics

**Logic** is a fundamental part of the foundations of mathematics. It studies the **principles of valid reasoning** and ensures that mathematical arguments are **rigorous and consistent**.

## 1. What Logic Studies
Logic focuses on **how to reason correctly**.  
- Determines whether statements or arguments are valid.
- Helps justify mathematical conclusions.

**Example:**
- Premise 1: All humans are mortal.  
- Premise 2: Socrates is a human.  
- Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.  
Logic explains why this conclusion **must** be true.

## 2. Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Propositions**      | Statements that are either true or false. <br> Example: “2 + 2 = 4” (true), “5 is even” (false) |
| **Logical Connectives** | And (∧), Or (∨), Not (¬) |
| **Quantifiers**       | ∀ (for all), ∃ (there exists) |
| **Implication**       | “If…then…” statements, e.g., \( P \implies Q \) |
| **Equivalence**       | Statements that are logically the same, e.g., \( P \iff Q \) |
| **Truth Tables**      | Tool to systematically check the validity of statements |

## 3. Purpose of Logic in Mathematics
- Provides a **framework for proofs**.  
- Ensures all mathematical statements are **unambiguous and reliable**.  
- Forms the backbone for other areas like **set theory, number theory, functions, and proof theory**.

---

## 4. Example in Mathematics
Let sets \(A\) and \(B\) be defined.  
- Statement: “If \(x \in A \cap B\), then \(x \in A\).”  
- Using logic, this can be **formally proved** based on the definition of intersection.  

This shows how **logic underlies all mathematical reasoning**.

## 5. Summary
- Logic studies **valid reasoning and proofs**.  
- It introduces **propositions, connectives, quantifiers, implication, and equivalence**.  
- Its main purpose is to make mathematics **rigorous, consistent, and trustworthy**.  
- All other areas of mathematics **depend on logic** as the foundational tool for reasoning.

*Logic is the “glue” that holds all of mathematics together.*
