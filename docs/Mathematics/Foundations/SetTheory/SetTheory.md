# Set Theory

Set Theory is the branch of mathematics that studies **collections of objects** (sets) and their relationships. It forms the **foundation for most areas of mathematics**, including numbers, functions, spaces, and probability.

## 1. What is a Set?
- A **set** is a collection of **distinct, well-defined objects** called **elements**.
- Elements can be **anything**: numbers, letters, objects, functions, or other sets.
- Sets **ignore order** and **repetition**.
- Denoted by `∈`: `a ∈ A` means `a` is an element of set `A`.
- **Empty set:** `∅` contains no elements.

## 2. Special Types of Sets
- **Universal set (U):** Contains all elements under consideration.  
- **Subset:** `A ⊆ B` means all elements of A are in B.  
- **Singleton set:** Contains exactly one element.  
- **Disjoint sets:** No common elements.  
- **Power set:** `P(A)` is the set of all subsets of A.  
- **Cartesian product:** `A × B = { (a,b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B }`. Order matters. Can be generalized to tuples of higher dimensions.

## 3. Set Operations
| Operation     | Notation | Meaning |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Union         | `A ∪ B`  | Elements in A **or** B |
| Intersection  | `A ∩ B`  | Elements in **both** A and B |
| Difference    | `A \ B`  | Elements in A **not in** B |
| Complement    | `Aᶜ`     | Elements **not in** A (relative to U) |

## 4. Relations and Functions
- **Relation:** A subset of `A × B`; defines how elements of one set relate to another.  
- **Function / Map:** A relation where **each element of the domain maps to exactly one element of the codomain**.  
  - Represented as a **set of ordered pairs** or as a **rule**.  
  - Example: `f: A → B` with `f(x) = x²`.

## 5. Why Set Theory is Foundational
1. **Building blocks:** 
  - Sets define numbers, functions/map, sequences, spaces, etc.
  - Groups, rings, vector spaces, probability, and more can be formally defined using sets. 
2. **Formal reasoning:** Provides the **language for logic and proofs**.

## 6. Summary
- **Set:** Collection of elements.  
- **Operations:** union, intersection, difference, complement.  
- **Functions/maps:** Domain → codomain, represented as sets of pairs.  
- **Cartesian product:** Forms tuples and higher-dimensional spaces.  
- **Foundational role:** Everything in mathematics can be represented and reasoned about using sets.
