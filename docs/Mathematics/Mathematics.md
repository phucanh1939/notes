# What is Mathematics

**Mathematics** is the science of **patterns, structures, quantities, and relationships**.  
It provides a precise language and logical framework to describe and understand both **abstract concepts** and **real-world phenomena**.

## ðŸ”¹ Core Ideas
- **Logic** â€“ reasoning and proof.  
- **Structure** â€“ how elements relate (e.g., groups, spaces, systems).  
- **Quantity** â€“ numbers, measurement, and change.  
- **Space** â€“ geometry, shape, and dimension.  
- **Pattern** â€“ repetition, symmetry, and regularity.

## ðŸ”¹ Main Branches
| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Foundations** | Define what math is built on | Set Theory, Logic |
| **Pure Mathematics** | Study abstract structures | Algebra, Geometry, Analysis |
| **Applied Mathematics** | Use math to model the real world | Statistics, Optimization, Physics |

## ðŸ”¹ In Essence
> **Mathematics** is the study of **patterns and logical structures** that form the foundation of science, technology, and reasoning itself.
