# Code to Execution (JavaScript)

There is no compiling to an platform-independent bytecode/IL instructions like java or C#. Javascript itself is an platform-independent instructions.

## Runing process

JavaScript files (typically `.js` files) are loaded and executed by a JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome or Node.js).

When you run a JavaScript application, such as by calling `node abc.js` or loading a script in a web browser, the following happens step by step:

1. **Script Loading**:
   - The **JavaScript Engine** reads the `.js` file and parses the JavaScript code into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**.
   - The engine then generates an intermediate representation of the code, often in the form of **bytecode** (e.g., V8â€™s Ignition bytecode).

2. **Bytecode Execution**:
   - When JavaScript code is called (for example, within a file that Node.js is running or from a `<script>` tag inside an HTML document), the JavaScript engine locates the bytecode for that code and executes it.
   - If the bytecode instruction has been **JIT compiled** previously (i.e., converted to machine code), the engine directly executes the compiled native binary instructions.
   - If the bytecode instruction has not been JIT-compiled yet, the JavaScript engine will interpret it or perform further optimizations, such as calling specific functions for handling operations (e.g., math or string manipulations).

3. **Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)**:
   - As the JavaScript application runs, the **JIT Compiler** compiles frequently executed JavaScript bytecode into native machine instructions, optimizing performance by reducing the need for interpretation on each execution.

4. **Garbage Collection (GC)**:
   - The **Garbage Collector (GC)** periodically runs in the background to manage memory. It identifies unused objects in memory and frees up space, improving performance and preventing memory leaks.

5. **Other JavaScript Engine Components**:
   - During execution, the JavaScript engine may involve other components for managing execution, optimizing code, or handling asynchronous operations.
