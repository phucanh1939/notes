# Computer Questions

## Why higher clock speeds and smaller transistors helped improve performance?

Higher clock speeds = Smaller time to complete a task (faster)

Smaller transistors = More transistors on same chip area = More computational units (ALU, caches, control logic)
Smaller transistors = Faster switching speeds = Faster execution

## What is a clock cycle in CPU?

## What is behind JSON parsing?

## What is a thread?

## We can capture (encode) sound and light (images), what about smell?

## How sound is encoded?

## How light is encoded?

## How search engine work?

## How to convert from assembly to a high-level language code (ex. C)

## Does MISP still be used and developed
