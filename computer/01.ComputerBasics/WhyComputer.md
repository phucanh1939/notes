# Why did human create computer

## In the first place


### Historical Reasons for the Creation of Computers

The creation of computers, in the first place, was driven by a need to solve specific problems and improve human capabilities in several key areas:

1. **Calculation and Computation**:
   - **Early Need**: Complex calculations were performed manually, which was time-consuming and error-prone.
   - **Motivation**: To automate and accelerate mathematical and scientific calculations. For example, Charles Babbage's concept of the Analytical Engine in the 19th century aimed to perform complex mathematical operations automatically.

2. **Data Processing for Scientific and Military Use**:
   - **Early Need**: Large-scale data processing was required for scientific research and military applications, such as code breaking during World War II.
   - **Motivation**: To handle large amounts of data more efficiently and accurately. The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), one of the earliest computers, was developed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army.

3. **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**:
   - **Early Need**: Repetitive tasks, such as census data tabulation, needed more efficient handling.
   - **Motivation**: To improve efficiency and reduce the manual labor involved in data processing. The Hollerith machine, an early data processing machine used for the 1890 U.S. Census, was a precursor to modern computers.

4. **Error Reduction**:
   - **Early Need**: Manual calculations were prone to errors, especially in large-scale computations.
   - **Motivation**: To create machines that could perform calculations more accurately and consistently. Computers were designed to reduce human error and improve reliability.

5. **Advancement of Scientific Knowledge**:
   - **Early Need**: Scientific research required complex computations and simulations.
   - **Motivation**: To provide scientists with tools that could assist in solving complex problems, such as those encountered in physics, chemistry, and engineering.

6. **Improvement of Engineering Design**:
   - **Early Need**: Engineering design and analysis required significant computational resources.
   - **Motivation**: To create machines that could assist in engineering calculations and simulations, improving the design and development process.

### Summary

The initial motivations for creating computers were driven by the need to automate and accelerate calculations, process large volumes of data, reduce errors, and support scientific and military applications. The early computers were developed to address these specific needs and have since evolved to handle a broad range of tasks, transforming many aspects of modern life. Keys:
    - Perform calculations much faster and more accurately (less errors) than humans
    - Complex calculations
    - Repeated tasks (Automation)
