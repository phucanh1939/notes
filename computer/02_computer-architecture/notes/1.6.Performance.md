# Performance

## What is Computer Performance?

The performance of a computer refers to how efficiently it can execute tasks, and it is often measured by how quickly it can complete a given workload.

## How to Evaluate Computer Performance (Some Key Metrics)

A **metric** is a way of measuring something.

### Execution Time (or Response Time) - System Performance

Execution time is the total time it takes for a computer to complete a task or program from start to finish. It includes all aspects of task execution, such as:
- Disk accesses
- Memory accesses
- I/O activities
- Operating system overhead
- CPU execution time

**Metric Focus:** System performance (how fast the entire system completes a task).

### Throughput - System Performance

Throughput refers to the number of tasks or jobs a computer can complete within a given period.

**Example:** A server's ability to handle multiple user requests simultaneously.

**Metric Focus:** System performance in terms of the volume of work completed over time.

### CPU Execution Time (CPU Time) - CPU Performance

CPU execution time, or CPU time, is the time the CPU spends actively computing for a specific task. It does **not** include time spent waiting for I/O or running other programs.

CPU time can be divided into:
- **User CPU time:** The time the CPU spends executing the program itself.
- **System CPU time:** The time the CPU spends performing tasks on behalf of the program (e.g., operating system activities).

**Metric Focus:** CPU performance (how fast the CPU executes a task).

### Clock Rate (Frequency)

Clock rate, or frequency, refers to the speed at which the CPUâ€™s clock generates pulses to control its operations, measured in Hertz (Hz). This represents the number of clock cycles that occur in one second.

**Example:**: A 3 GHz processor has a clock rate of 3 billion clock cycles per second (3 GHz = 3 billion Hertz).

**Metric Focus:** CPU performance - higher clock rates usually mean more operations per second.

## CPU performance and its factor

Formula to calculate CPU execution time for a program base on its clock cycles and clock cycle time of the CPU

```
CPU_EXECUTION_TIME (for a program) = NUMBER_OF_CPU_CLOCK_CYCLES (for this program) * CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME (time of each clock cycle)

CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME = 1 / CLOCK_RATE

CPU_EXECUTION_TIME (for a program) = NUMBER_OF_CPU_CLOCK_CYCLES (for this program) / CLOCK_RATE
```
=> To improve performance of a CPU, we can reduce NUMBER_OF_CPU_CLOCKS_CYCLES required by a program but it will increase  the length of each 
cycle (clock cycle time). This is a trade-off

Ex. A program has 10s execution time run on a 2GHz CPU will has NUMBER_OF_CPU_CLOCKS_CYCLES = 10s * 2GHz = 20 bilion clock cycles

## Instruction performance

Compiler will compile program to instructions to execute. Therefor, one way to think about execution time is that it equals the number of  
instructions executed multiplied by the average time per instruction

```
NUMBER_OF_CPU_CLOCK_CYCLES (for a program) = NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS * AVERAGE_CLOCK_CYCLES_PER_INSTRUCTION
```

The term **Clock Cycles per Instruction** (CPI) refers to Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program 

### Calculating CPI for CPU Comparison

The **actual CPI (Clock Cycles Per Instruction)** depends on the specific program being run. To calculate a general CPI for a CPU, especially for comparison purposes, we assume the program includes **all instructions in the ISA** (Instruction Set Architecture), with each instruction type weighted based on how frequently it is expected to occur in typical programs.

- For example, let's assume a program where:
  - **50%** of the instructions are **arithmetic operations** (e.g., ADD, SUB).
  - **30%** are **memory access instructions** (e.g., LOAD, STORE).
  - **20%** are **branching instructions** (e.g., JUMP, BRANCH).

We know that each instruction type will take a **fixed number of clock cycles** to execute on a given CPU.  
- For instance, on **CPU A**, an **ADD** instruction might consistently take **4 clock cycles**.

### Steps to Calculate CPI:
1. **Calculate Total Clock Cycles**:  
   Using the instruction mix and the clock cycles for each type of instruction, we can calculate the **TOTAL_CLOCK_CYCLES** required to execute the assumed program on the CPU.

2. **Calculate CPI**:  
   The **CPI** can be calculated using the formula:
   ```
   CPI = TOTAL_CLOCK_CYCLES / TOTAL_INSTRUCTIONS_EXECUTED
   ```

This approach allows us to estimate the CPI for a CPU without needing to explicitly measure execution time, facilitating performance comparisons between different CPUs.


## The Classic CPU Performance Equation

Finally we has the CPU_EXECUTION_TIME formula

```
CPU_EXECUTION_TIME = NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS * CPI * CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME

or

CPU_EXECUTION_TIME = NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS * CPI / CLOCK_RATE
```

These formulas separate the three key factors that affect CPU performance:

1. **Number of Instructions**: The total count of instructions of the program (NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS for the same program may differ on different CPUs due to ISA, CPU architeture design, Compiler Optimization, etc)
2. **CPI (Clock Cycles Per Instruction)**: The average number of clock cycles each instruction takes.
3. **Clock Cycle Time** or **Clock Rate**: The duration of one clock cycle, which inversely affects the CPU's performance.

### Application of the Formulas

We can use these formulas to:

- Compare two different CPU implementations.
- Evaluate a design alternative by assessing its impact on these three parameters.
- Improve performance for a program we write.

### Example of Optimization

When writing performance-critical code, selecting efficient operations can significantly impact execution time. For instance, if we know that the **DIVIDE** instruction requires more clock cycles to execute than the **MULTIPLY** instruction, we can choose to use **multiplication** instead of **division** in our code.

**Instead of using:**

```c
x = sum / 2f;
```

**We use:**

```c
x = sum * 0.5f;
```
