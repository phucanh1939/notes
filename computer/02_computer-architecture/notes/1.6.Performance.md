# Performance

## What is Computer Performance?

The performance of a computer refers to how efficiently it can execute tasks, and it is often measured by how quickly it can complete a given workload.

## How to Evaluate Computer Performance (Some Key Metrics)

A **metric** is a way of measuring something.

### Execution Time (or Response Time) - System Performance

Execution time is the total time it takes for a computer to complete a task or program from start to finish. It includes all aspects of task execution, such as:
- Disk accesses
- Memory accesses
- I/O activities
- Operating system overhead
- CPU execution time

**Metric Focus:** System performance (how fast the entire system completes a task).

### Throughput - System Performance

Throughput refers to the number of tasks or jobs a computer can complete within a given period.

**Example:** A server's ability to handle multiple user requests simultaneously.

**Metric Focus:** System performance in terms of the volume of work completed over time.

### CPU Execution Time (CPU Time) - CPU Performance

CPU execution time, or CPU time, is the time the CPU spends actively computing for a specific task. It does **not** include time spent waiting for I/O or running other programs.

CPU time can be divided into:
- **User CPU time:** The time the CPU spends executing the program itself.
- **System CPU time:** The time the CPU spends performing tasks on behalf of the program (e.g., operating system activities).

**Metric Focus:** CPU performance (how fast the CPU executes a task).

### Clock Rate (Frequency)

Clock rate, or frequency, refers to the speed at which the CPUâ€™s clock generates pulses to control its operations, measured in Hertz (Hz). This represents the number of clock cycles that occur in one second.

**Example:**: A 3 GHz processor has a clock rate of 3 billion clock cycles per second (3 GHz = 3 billion Hertz).

**Metric Focus:** CPU performance - higher clock rates usually mean more operations per second.
