- After transistors was created, processors and memory have  improved  at  an  incredible  rate.
- Number of transistors on a chip doubled every 2-3 years (Moo)
- Chip manufacturing process:

-> Silicon ingot 
-> Sliced into wafers 
-> 20-40 steps (add materials to silicon to make it conductor, insulator or semi) to create partterned wafers
-> Dice wafer into Dies (each die a chip)
-> packaged dies
-> customer
