# Computer History

## Why Computing Devices?

- Perform calculations much faster and more accurately (less errors) than humans
- Complex calculations
- Repeated tasks (Automation)

## Milestones

1. **Abacus (3000 BCE)**: The abacus is one of the earliest known computing devices. It consists of beads or stones on rods or wires and is used for performing arithmetic calculations.

2. **Napier's Bones (1617)**: Invented by John Napier, Napier's Bones were a set of numbered rods or bones used for multiplication and division calculations. They provided a mechanical means of performing calculations more efficiently.

3. **Pascaline (1642)**: The Pascaline, invented by Blaise Pascal, was a mechanical calculator that could perform addition and subtraction. It used a series of gears and wheels to automate calculations.

4. **Stepped Reckoner (1673)**: Designed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the Stepped Reckoner was a mechanical calculator capable of performing all four arithmetic operations. It introduced the concept of a stepped drum mechanism for calculation.

5. **Difference Engine (1822)**: The Difference Engine, designed by Charles Babbage, was an automatic mechanical calculator capable of computing polynomial functions. It used the method of finite differences to perform calculations.

6. **Analytical Engine (1837)**: Also designed by Charles Babbage, the Analytical Engine was a general-purpose mechanical computer that could perform complex calculations and store data in memory. It is considered a precursor to modern computers.

7. **Mark I (1944)**: The Harvard Mark I, also known as the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, was an electromechanical computer developed by Harvard University in collaboration with IBM. It used electromechanical relays and rotating shafts for computation.

8. **ENIAC (1945)**: The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. It used vacuum tubes for computation and marked a significant shift from electromechanical to electronic computing.

9. **Transistor Invention (1947)**: The invention of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 revolutionized electronics and computer technology. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes and offered advantages such as smaller size, lower power consumption, and increased reliability.

10. **Fortran(1950s)**: Fortran (Formula Translation), developed by IBM in the 1950s. Fortran was designed for scientific and engineering calculations and played a significant role in the early days of computer programming. Other early programming languages include COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) and ALGOL (Algorithmic Language).

10. **Integrated Circuits (1960s)**: The development of integrated circuits in the 1960s allowed multiple transistors and other electronic components to be miniaturized and fabricated on a single chip. This advancement led to smaller, more powerful, and more affordable computers.

11. **Microprocessors (1971)**: The invention of the microprocessor by Intel in 1971 revolutionized computer design. Microprocessors combined the central processing unit (CPU) onto a single chip, making computers more compact and paving the way for personal computers.

12. **Internet (1960s-1980s)**: The Internet, a global network of interconnected computers, began to take shape in the 1960s and 1970s through various research and government initiatives. By the 1980s, the Internet had evolved into a network that allowed for the exchange of information and communication between computers worldwide.

13. **IBM PC (1981)**: The IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) was introduced in 1981 and became the standard for personal computing. It utilized microprocessors and an open architecture, leading to the widespread adoption of personal computers.

14. **Graphical User Interface (1983)**: The introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as Apple's Macintosh in 1984 and Microsoft Windows in 1985, made computers more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.

15. **CD-ROM (1985)**: The introduction of the Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) in 1985 revolutionized data storage and distribution. CD-ROMs allowed for large amounts of data to be stored and accessed on optical discs, enabling the widespread distribution of software, multimedia, and reference materials.

16. **World Wide Web (1989)**: In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which revolutionized the way information is shared and accessed. The web made it possible to navigate and link documents across different computers, leading to the rapid growth of the internet and the modern internet-based services we use today.

17. **Windows 95 (1995)**: The release of Windows 95 by Microsoft brought significant improvements to the user interface and introduced features such as the Start menu and taskbar. It was a major step forward in making personal computers more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

18. **DVD (1997)**: The Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) was introduced in 1997 as the successor to CD-ROMs. DVDs offered higher storage capacity and improved video and audio quality, making them popular for movies, software distribution, and data backup.

19. **Wi-Fi (1997)**: The introduction of Wi-Fi technology allowed for wireless connectivity to local area networks and the internet. Wi-Fi made it possible for devices to connect to networks without the need for physical cables, enabling greater mobility and convenience.

20. **Mobile Computing (2000s)**: The rise of smartphones and tablets in the 2000s brought about a new era of mobile computing, enabling people to access information and perform tasks on the go.
