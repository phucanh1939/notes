# ARMv8 Registers

## General-Purpose Registers
These are 64-bit registers used for computation and data storage.

## Notes

### w0-w31 & wzr

The `w0 - w31` registers are the lower 32-bits of the corresponding `x0 - x31` registers.

The `wzr` is the lower 32-bites of `xzr`

### Difference between CPSR and NZCV

| Feature            | **CPSR**                          | **NZCV**                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Content**        | Contains condition flags (N, Z, C, V), control flags (I, F, T), and interrupt status. | Only contains the **N, Z, C, V** flags from the CPSR (the condition flags). |
| **Size**           | 32 bits (for AArch32) or 64 bits (for AArch64, in a different register set). | 4 bits (just for **N, Z, C, V** flags). |
| **Purpose**        | Manages processor status, condition flags, interrupt control, and mode flags. | Represents only the condition flags (N, Z, C, V) from the CPSR, typically used in conditional instruction execution. |
| **Access**         | The full CPSR is typically accessed to control interrupts, check processor status, and handle exceptions. | The NZCV flags are often used in conditional execution to check the status of the last arithmetic/logical operation. |

### Flags

#### Condition flags
- N (Negative)  : Set if the result of the last operation was negative.
- Z (Zero)      : Set if the result of the last operation was zero.
- C (Carry)     : Set if the last operation generated a carry (for addition) or borrow (for subtraction).
- V (Overflow)  : Set if the last operation caused an overflow.

#### Control flags:
- I: Interrupt disable
- F: Fast interrupt disable
- T: Thumb instruction set indicator

### Caller-saved registers

`Caller-saved` registers are typically saved by the caller before calling another function, and restored after the function call

```s
foo:
    stp x10, x11, [sp, #-16]!    ; Save caller-saved registers (x10, x11) to stack
    bl bar                     ; Call the function bar
    ldp x10, x11, [sp], #16      ; Restore x10, x11 from stack after bar returns
    ; Continue using x10, x11 here

bar:
    ; Function body, caller-saved registers (x0, x1) can be used or modified
    ret                         ; Return to foo
```

### Callee-saved registers

`Callee-saved` registers are registers that the called function (callee) is responsible for preserving. If a function (the callee) uses a callee-saved register, it must save the value of that register at the beginning of the function and restore it before returning to the caller.

```s
foo:
    bl bar                         ; Call bar

bar:
    stp x19, x20, [sp, #-16]!      ; Save callee-saved registers
    ; Do work, modifying x19, x20
    ldp x19, x20, [sp], #16        ; Restore callee-saved registers
    ret                            ; Return to foo

```
