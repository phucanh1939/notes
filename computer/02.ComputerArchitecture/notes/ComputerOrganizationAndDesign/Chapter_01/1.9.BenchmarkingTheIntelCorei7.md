## Real Stuff: Benchmarking the Intel Core i7

SPEC (System Performance Evaluation Cooperative) is an eff ort funded and 
supported by a number of computer vendors to create standard sets of benchmarks 
for modern computer systems.

*SPECINTC2006 benchmarks running on a 2.66 GHz Intel Core i7 920*

Where:
    - Instruction Count: The number of instructions executed during the benchmark (in billions).
    - CPI: Cycles per instruction, which measures how many clock cycles are needed to execute one instruction.
    - Clock Cycle Time: The time for one clock cycle (in nanoseconds), which is constant at 0.376 ns in this benchmark.
    - Execution Time: Time taken by the processor to execute the benchmark workload.
    - Reference Time: The reference time provided by SPEC to calculate the SPECratio.
    - SPECratio: = Reference Time / Execution time ~ How fast the CPU running the test is compare to the reference one
    - Geometric Mean: To simplify the marketing of computers, SPEC decided to report a single number to summarize all 12 integer benchmarks

*SPECpower_ssj2008 running on a dual socket 2.66 GHz Intel Xeon X5650 with 16 GB of DRAM and one 100 GB SSD*

Where:
    - Target Load: The percentage of the server's maximum performance or capacity that is being used during the test.
    - Performance (ssj_ops): Server-side Java Operations per second - how many server-side operations the system can handle per second at a given load
    - Average Power: Average power consumption of the server in watts during the test at each load level
    - ∑ssj_ops / ∑power : To simplify the marketing of computers, SPEC decided to report a single number to summarize the result
