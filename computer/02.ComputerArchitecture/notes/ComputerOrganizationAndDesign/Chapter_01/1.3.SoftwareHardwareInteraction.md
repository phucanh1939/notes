## Software-Hardware Interaction

There are multiple layers of abstraction between the program written by a developer and the hardware that eventually executes it. These layers help manage complexity by providing different levels of detail, allowing programmers to write high-level code while relying on the underlying system to handle low-level details.

### High-Level Program

The developer writes the program in a high-level language (e.g., C++, Python).

### Compiler

The program is translated by the compiler or interpreter into machine code which is a binary representation of instructions. These instructions conform to the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the target CPU.

The ISA defines which operations the CPU can perform (e.g., add, subtract, load, store) and the format for encoding these operations in machine code.

### Operating System (OS)

The machine code is executed within the context of the operating system, which handles resource management and higher-level tasks.

- The OS loads the programâ€™s binary into memory.
- The OS sets up a process with all the resources the program needs.
- The OS tells the CPU to start executing the program from its entry point (the first instruction).
- The CPU fetches and executes the binary instructions until completion or an OS interrupt occurs.
