# Performance

The performance of a computer refers to how efficiently it can execute tasks, and it is often measured by how quickly it can complete a given workload.

## System performance

### Execution Time (or Response Time)

Execution time is the total time it takes for a computer to complete a task or program from start to finish. It includes all aspects of task execution, such as:
- Disk accesses
- Memory accesses
- I/O activities
- Operating system overhead
- CPU execution time

### Throughput - System Performance

Throughput refers to the number of tasks or jobs a computer can complete within a given period.

## CPU Performance

### CPU Execution Time

CPU execution time, or CPU time, is the time the CPU spends actively computing for a specific task. It does **not** include time spent waiting for I/O or running other programs.

```
CPU_EXECUTION_TIME = NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS * CPI * CLOCK_CYCLE_TIME

or

CPU_EXECUTION_TIME = NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS * CPI / CLOCK_RATE
```

These formulas separate the three key factors that affect CPU performance:

1. **Number of Instructions**: The total count of instructions of the program (NUMBER_OF_INSTRUCTIONS for the same program may differ on different CPUs due to ISA, CPU architeture design, Compiler Optimization, etc)
2. **CPI (Clock Cycles Per Instruction)**: The average number of clock cycles each instruction takes.
3. **Clock Cycle Time** or **Clock Rate**: The duration of one clock cycle, which inversely affects the CPU's performance.
