## Chip Manufacturing Process

### Evolution of Electronic Components

- **Transistor**: A transistor acts as an on/off switch controlled by electrical signals. The invention and implementation of transistors replaced vacuum tubes, leading to smaller, faster, and more efficient circuits.

- **Integrated Circuit (IC)**: The integrated circuit combines multiple transistors into a single chip.

- **Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI)**: chip with hundreds of thousands to millions of transistors,

- **Ultra Large-Scale Integration (ULSI)**: chips with billions of transistors

### Manufacturing Process

- Silicon Ingot: The process begins with a silicon crystal ingot, a large cylindrical piece of silicon that can be 8 to 12 inches in diameter and 12 to 24 inches long.

- Wafer Slicing: The ingot is sliced into thin wafers, typically no more than 0.1 inches thick.

- Patterning: Each wafer undergoes 20 to 40 processing steps, where patterns of chemicals are applied to create transistors, conductors, and insulators.

- Dicing: After processing, the wafer is diced into individual dies (chips). This allows for the disposal of only defective dies, improving overall yield.

- Bonding: The good dies are then bonded to packages, connecting them to input/output pins for final testing.

### Manufacturing Cost

The cost of integrated circuits is influenced by several factors, including die size and yield rates. As the size of a die increases, costs tend to rise due to lower yields and a reduced number of dies that fit on a wafer. To mitigate these costs, manufacturers adopt smaller processes, leading to more compact and efficient designs. For example, a 32-nanometer (nm) process signifies that the smallest features on the die measure approximately 32 nm.

Equations:

1. Cost per die = Cost per wafer / (Dies per wafer × Yield)
2. Dies per wafer = Wafer area / Die area
3. Yield = 1 - (Defects per area) x (Die area/2)^2
