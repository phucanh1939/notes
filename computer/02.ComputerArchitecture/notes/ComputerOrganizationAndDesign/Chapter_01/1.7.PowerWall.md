# Power Wall

As processors become faster and more powerful, they consume significantly more energy. Traditionally, higher clock speeds and smaller transistors helped improve performance, but they also led to increased power usage and heat dissipation issues.

## Dynamic Power Equation

The dynamic power consumed by a processor is governed by the formula:

```
Power = C x V^2 x f
```

Where:
- C is the capacitance switched per clock cycle (related to transistor size).
- V is the voltage.
- f is the clock frequency.

Increasing the clock rate (f) leads to more power consumption, while reducing the voltage (V) can help save power, but only up to a point (due to Leakage Power as explained below).

## Voltage Reduction and Leakage Power

Reducing voltage was historically an effective way to manage power consumption. However, as voltages drop too low, leakage power (static power) becomes a significant factor. Leakage power is due to the inability to fully shut off transistors, causing them to "leak" current even when idle (transistors consume power even they are off)

As voltages decrease further, leakage becomes more prominent, and this leads to a large portion of power being consumed by leakage currents rather than dynamic switching.

## Power Wall

The Power Wall is the practical limit where further performance improvements through increasing clock speed or reducing voltage become ineffective due to excessive power consumption and heat dissipation.

Modern processors are constrained by this power wall, and simply increasing clock speeds to improve performance is no longer a feasible approach.

## Shift to Multi-Core and Parallelism

Since increasing clock speed (frequency) is no longer a viable path for performance gains, the industry has shifted toward multi-core processors. Instead of making a single core faster, multiple cores are used to perform tasks in parallel, improving performance without significantly increasing power consumption.

## Power-Efficient Architectures

Current trends focus on more power-efficient architectures, where energy efficiency is as important as raw performance. Innovations like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and specialized low-power cores help mitigate power challenges.
