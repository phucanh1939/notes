## Computer Components

A typical computer system consists of several key components, including the CPU (data path & control path), memory, input/output devices, and storage. Each component plays a vital role in processing and managing data.

### The Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It interacts with memory and I/O devices to carry out tasks as defined by software programs.

CPU includes data path and control path:
- The data path manages the flow of data between registers, the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and memory.
- The control path directs the operation of the data path and coordinates the execution of instructions.

### Memory
Memory stores data and instructions temporarily for quick access by the CPU

### I/O Devices

- Input devices write data to the memory (Ex. keyboard, mouse, etc.)
- Output devices read data from the meory to present to users (Ex. monitor)
