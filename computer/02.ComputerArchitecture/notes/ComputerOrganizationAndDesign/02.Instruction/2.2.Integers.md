# Integer Representation in Computers
Computers represent integers in **binary** (base-2). There are two main types:
1. **Unsigned Integers**
2. **Signed Integers**

## 1. Unsigned Integers
- Represent non-negative numbers (0 and positive).
- All bits store the number's magnitude.
- For `n` bits: range is `0` to `2^n - 1`.

### Example (4-bit unsigned):
- `0000` = 0
- `1111` = 15

## 2. Signed Integers (Two's Complement)
Signed integers represent both positive and negative numbers. The most common system for representing signed integers is two's complement.
- The **most significant bit (MSB)** is the **sign bit** (`0` for positive, `1` for negative).
- Negative numbers are represented by **inverting all bits** and **adding 1** (Negation Shortcut)
- For `n` bits: range is `-2^(n-1)` to `2^(n-1) - 1`.

### Example (4-bit two's complement):
- Positive: `0001` = 1, `0111` = 7
- Negative: `1111` = -1, `1000` = -8

### Why the Negation Shortcut Works
From `x + invert_all_bits(x) = -1`, we get `-x = invert_all_bits(x) + 1`.

#### Example:
```
x = 5 (0101)
invert_all_bits_of_x = 1010
x + invert_all_bits_of_x = 1111
-x = invert_all_bits_of_x + 1 = 1010 + 1 = 1011 (-5 in base 10)
```

### Why Two's Complement instead of using 1st bit as sign bit and the rest as unsigned int
- Single Zero Representation: There's only one zero (0000 for 4 bits), avoiding the issue of having both +0 and -0.
- Simple Arithmetic: Addition and subtraction work the same way for both positive and negative numbers, simplifying hardware design.

### Why is it called "two's complement"
When you take an n-bit number `x` and add it to its two's complement representation (its negative `-x`), the result is `2^n`. 
This is because, in binary arithmetic, the sum of a number and its negation will cause a carry that exceeds the maximum representable value for n bits.

#### Example
```
n = 4 (4-bits)
x = 3 = 0011
-x = 1101
0011 + 1101 = 1 0000 (exceeds 4 bits with a carry of 1) = 2 ^ 4 = 16
```

## Extending Integers
When converting a smaller integer (like 16-bit) to a larger one (like 32-bit):
- Unsigned integers: fill the new bits with 0 (called zero-extension).
- Signed integers (two's complement): You extend the sign bit (MSB) to fill the new bits, keeping the value's sign intact (called sign-extension).

### Example:
- 16-bit `-5` (two's complement): `1111 1111 1111 1011`
- 32-bit `-5`: `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1011`

### Why sign extension work
- For positive numbers, adding `0`s leaves the value unchanged.
- For negative numbers, use the **negation shortcut**:
  1. Find the positive value by inverting the bits and adding `1`.
  2. Zero-extend the positive value.
  3. Convert back to negative using the **negation shortcut**, resulting in extended bits being filled with `1`s.
