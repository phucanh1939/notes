# Control Flow Instruction

Control Flow Instruction is instructions that manage the program execution flow, allowing it to make decisions and change direction based on conditions.

Main categories:

## Conditional Branch Instructions

Instructions that alter the flow based on specific conditions

Examples: BEQ (Branch if Equal), BNE (Branch if Not Equal), BLT (Branch if Less Than), SLT (Set on less than)

## Unconditional Branch (or Jump) Instructions

These instructions redirect execution flow to a specified address

Examples: JMP (Jump)
