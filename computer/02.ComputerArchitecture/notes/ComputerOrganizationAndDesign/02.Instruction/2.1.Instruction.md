# Introduction

## What is an Instruction?

An instruction is a single, binary-encoded operation that a processor can understand and execute.

Each instruction typically consists of two parts:
- Operation code (opcode): Specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., add, load, store).
- Operands: Specifies the data or addresses on which the operation will act (e.g., registers, memory locations, or immediate values).

Example: `ADD R1, R2, R3` is an instruction that tell the CPU add values in registers `R2`, `R3` and store the result in `R1`

### Operations (Operators)

In an instruction, the operation indicates what action is to be performed (e.g., adding, subtracting, loading data).

Examples:
- Arithmetic operations: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
- Logical operations: AND, OR, NOT
- Data movement operations: LOAD, STORE, MOVE
- Control flow operations: JUMP, CALL, RETURN

### Operands

Operands are the data or values on which the operations act

Examples:
- Registers: e.g., R1, R2 (which may contain data or memory addresses)
- Memory addresses: e.g., 0x0040
- Immediate values: e.g., 5, 10 (constant values in the instruction)

#### Register

A register is a small, high-speed storage location inside the CPU that is used to store data temporarily while the CPU is executing instructions

#### Memory address

A memory address is a unique identifier that represents a specific location in a computerâ€™s memory (RAM)

Byte Addressable Memory: Most modern computers are byte-addressable, meaning each address points to a single byte of memory

#### Immediate value

An **immediate value** is a constant directly encoded into an instruction. For example, in `addi $s0, $s1, 5`, the immediate value `5` is added to the value in `$s1` and stored in `$s0`. The binary representation for the instruction could look like: `| 001000 | 10001 | 10000 | 0000 0000 0000 0101 |`, where the last 16 bits represent `5`. The CPU reads this immediate value directly from the instruction itself instead of from register like `add`

Since only 16 bits are available, immediate values range from `-32,768` to `32,767`. If an immediate value exceeds this, like `addi $s0, $zero, 100000000`, it results in an error when assembler try to convert it to binary because it surpasses the 16-bit limit. Compilers avoid generating such invalid instructions and break them into smaller steps.

## What is an Instruction Set

The instruction set is the complete set of instructions that a CPU can recognize and execute
