# Introduction

## What is an Instruction?

An instruction is a single, binary-encoded operation that a processor can understand and execute.

Each instruction typically consists of two parts:
- Operation code (opcode): Specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., add, load, store).
- Operands: Specifies the data or addresses on which the operation will act (e.g., registers, memory locations, or immediate values).

Example: `ADD R1, R2, R3` is an instruction that tell the CPU add values in registers `R2`, `R3` and store the result in `R1`

### Operations (Operators)

In an instruction, the operation indicates what action is to be performed (e.g., adding, subtracting, loading data).

Examples:
- Arithmetic operations: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
- Logical operations: AND, OR, NOT
- Data movement operations: LOAD, STORE, MOVE
- Control flow operations: JUMP, CALL, RETURN

### Operands

Operands are the data or values on which the operations act

Examples:
- Registers: e.g., R1, R2 (which may contain data or memory addresses)
- Memory addresses: e.g., 0x0040
- Immediate values: e.g., 5, 10 (constant values in the instruction)

#### Register

A register is a small, high-speed storage location inside the CPU that is used to store data temporarily while the CPU is executing instructions

#### Memory address

A memory address is a unique identifier that represents a specific location in a computerâ€™s memory (RAM)

Byte Addressable Memory: Most modern computers are byte-addressable, meaning each address points to a single byte of memory

#### Immediate value

An **immediate value** is a constant directly encoded into an instruction. For example, in `addi $s0, $s1, 5`, the immediate value `5` is added to the value in `$s1` and stored in `$s0`. The binary representation for the instruction could look like: `| 001000 | 10001 | 10000 | 0000 0000 0000 0101 |`, where the last 16 bits represent `5`. The CPU reads this immediate value directly from the instruction itself instead of from register like `add`

Since only 16 bits are available, immediate values range from `-32,768` to `32,767`. If an immediate value exceeds this, like `addi $s0, $zero, 100000000`, it results in an error when assembler try to convert it to binary because it surpasses the 16-bit limit. Compilers avoid generating such invalid instructions and break them into smaller steps.

## What is an Instruction Set

The instruction set is the complete set of instructions that a CPU can recognize and execute

## Representing Instructions in the Computer

Instructions in a computer are binary sequences that follow specific formats for the CPU to execute.
Like data, instructions are stored in memory, simplifying both memory hardware and software design. (the memory technology needed for
data can also be used for programs)

### Example. MIPS Instruction Formats

Each register in MIPS is assigned a specific number used in instructions. For example, `$t1` is register `9`, represented in binary as `01001`.

- **R-format** (used for register operations):  
    - Structure: `op` (6 bits) | `rs` (5 bits) | `rt` (5 bits) | `rd` (5 bits) | `shamt` (5 bits) | `funct` (6 bits)
    - **Field Descriptions**:
      - `op`: Operation code, specifies the type of instruction.
      - `rs`: Source register 1.
      - `rt`: Source register 2.
      - `rd`: Destination register, where the result is stored.
      - `shamt`: Shift amount, used in shift instructions.
      - `funct`: Function code, further specifies the operation for the CPU.
    - Example: The instruction `add $t0, $t1, $t2` (add values in `$t1` and `$t2` and store in `$t0`)  
      - `op`: 000000 | `rs`: 01001 | `rt`: 01010 | `rd`: 01000 | `shamt`: 00000 | `funct`: 100000


- **I-format** (used for immediate values):
    - Structure: `op` (6 bits) | `rs` (5 bits) | `rt` (5 bits) | `immediate` (16 bits)
    - **Field Descriptions**:
      - `op`: Operation code, specifies the type of instruction.
      - `rs`: Source register.
      - `rt`: Destination register, where the result is stored.
      - `immediate`: A 16-bit constant value used directly in the operation.
    - Example: The instruction `addi $t0, $t1, 10` (add immediate value `10` to `$t1` and store in `$t0`)  
      - `op`: 001000 | `rs`: 01001 | `rt`: 01000 | `immediate`: 0000000000001010



Each format provides a compact 32-bit layout for efficient CPU operations.
