## Key Concepts in Computer Architecture

Eight foundational concepts that have driven advances in computer architecture over the years. These ideas serve as guiding principles for designing and improving computer systems.

### Design for Moore's Law:
Moore's Law predicts that the number of transistors on a chip will double approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power. Computer architects must design with this exponential growth in mind to harness the increasing number of transistors for better performance.

### Use Abstraction to Simplify Design:
Abstraction allows architects to break down complex systems into simpler, more manageable components. By creating well-defined interfaces between layers of abstraction (e.g., hardware and software), designers can manage complexity more effectively and focus on improving specific components without disrupting the whole system.

### Make the Common Case Fast:
Optimizing for the most frequently occurring scenarios yields the greatest performance gains. By focusing resources on speeding up the common case, designers can improve overall performance more significantly than optimizing rare or uncommon scenarios.

### Performance via Parallelism:
Exploiting parallelism allows computers to execute multiple instructions simultaneously. This can involve multiple processors (multi-core systems), pipelines, or other forms of concurrency that help improve throughput and efficiency.

### Performance via Pipelining:
Pipelining divides the execution of instructions into discrete stages, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously at different stages. This technique helps increase throughput by ensuring that parts of the processor are continually working on different instructions.

### Performance via Prediction:
Using prediction techniques, such as branch prediction, enables the computer to guess the outcomes of instructions that depend on uncertain conditions (e.g., if statements) and continue executing without waiting for the actual outcome. When done correctly, this improves overall performance by reducing delays.

### Hierarchy of Memories:
Memory is organized in a hierarchy, from the fastest but smallest (e.g., cache memory) to the slowest but largest (e.g., hard disk storage). By storing frequently accessed data in the faster levels of the hierarchy, computers can reduce the time spent accessing data, resulting in better performance.

### Dependability via Redundancy:
Redundancy is used to improve the dependability and reliability of computer systems. By duplicating critical components (such as power supplies, processors, or storage units), systems can continue to function even if one component fails, ensuring greater reliability in the long run.
