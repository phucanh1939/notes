## Introduction

### The Role of Computers in Modern Life
Computers have become an essential part of modern life, driving innovation in everything from personal devices to large-scale data centers. The rapid evolution of computing technology is discussed as an ongoing trend.

### Types/Classes of Computers
- Personal Computers (PCs) : A computer designed for use by an individual, usually incorporating a graphics display, a keyboard, and a mouse.
- Servers : A computer used for running larger programs for multiple users, often simultaneously, and typically accessed only via a network.
- Supercomputers : A class of computers with the highest performance and cost; they are configured as servers and typically cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.
- Embedded Computers : A computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application or collection of software.
- Personal mobile devices (PMDs): Smartphones, tablets
- Cloud Computing: large collections of servers that provide services over the Internet for people to rent;

### Challenges in Computer Design
While computing power has steadily increased (driven by Mooreâ€™s Law), this improvement brings challenges such as managing power consumption, designing for parallelism, and ensuring reliability.
