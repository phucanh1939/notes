## From Uniprocessors to Multiprocessors

With the limitations of uniprocessor systems becoming apparent, such as power consumption and heat dissipation issues, the shift to multiprocessors has become more prevalent.

### Performance Advantages

The transition to multiprocessors allows for improved performance through parallel processing, enabling multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. This parallelism can significantly enhance throughput and reduce execution time for applications that can be parallelized.

### Programming Challenges

While multiprocessors offer performance benefits, they also introduce challenges in programming and software design: writing/re-writing software that efficiently utilizes multiple processors, including issues related to synchronization, data sharing, and workload distribution.

### Implications for Design

The shift to multiprocessors has significant implications for computer architecture, including the need for new design methodologies and a focus on parallelism in both hardware and software.
